				Some may ask, "Why is there a "military theme" throughout this site?  
				Is such a warlike theme "appropriate" for a site which has to do with Biblical orientation whose ultimate goal is peace?" 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is an appropriate question to ask by many Biblically oriented persons,  especially by those who are committed to the regathering of the Tribes of Israel. 
				The main reasons for a military theme for the RegatheringTenTribes.org are contained in the inspired wisdom of King Solomon: 
			</p>
			<center>
				<p class="constrict blue justify">
					To every thing there is a <strong>season</strong>, and a <strong>time</strong> to every <strong>purpose</strong> under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to <strong>plant</strong>, and a time to <strong>pluck up</strong> that which is planted; A time to <strong>kill</strong>, and a time to <strong>heal</strong>; a time to <strong>break down</strong>, and a time to <strong>build up</strong>;  
					— Ecc. 3:1-3 KJV
				<p>
			</center>
			<br/>
			<p>
				This key verse contains all the essential activities that a military operation does.  These are also all necessary tasks that the Almighty’s Remnant is required to do.  
				Here is a short correlation of Solomon’s observation of the scope of human activities (everything) and the assigned specially purposed “holy tasks” for the Remnant to do. 
			</p>
			<center>
				<p>
					<strong>Purpose:</strong>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span class="blue">The LORD is a man of war, The LORD is His name. ְהוָה אִישׁ מִלְחָמָה יְהוָה שְׁמו <br/><br/>—  Ex. 15:3 KJV</span>                                                          
				</p>
			</center>
			<p>
				The God of Israel calls himself “A Man of War.” The very purpose, the singular raison d’etre of the Remnant is to be a “saving” 
				Remnant in the “service” of the same God of Israel who went to war in order to save Israel from slavish imprisonment in idolatrous Egypt.  
				In the first commandment God’s primary identity is intrinsically connected to having brought Israel out of bondage.  This “saving” event was an “act of war.”
			</p>
			<center>
				<p class="constrict blue">
					I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
								         <br/><br/>— Ex. 20:3 KJV  
				</p>
			</center>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The “saving Remnant” of this “Man of War” is called to <strong>serve</strong> as God’s appointed special forces, “armed” 
				with the power of God’s Spirit to carry out essential parts of His plan for saving Israel in times of existential crises.  
				Yes, it is a “service” just as the armed forces of our countries are a “service” with multiple tasks. 
				Yet, as “government issues” (GIs) of the Almighty, the overall purpose of His Remnant is to defend and promote the safety of the 
				people whose God-given values and government they are sworn to uphold. In our days these ”special forces” can be best understood by 
				likening them to the official “<strong>C</strong>onstruction <strong>B</strong>attalion” of the United States Navy. 
				These men have gallantly distinguished themselves as the vital preparatory leading edge of our armed forces around the world.  
				They were popularly called “Seabees,” mostly senior men who were experienced in the trades necessary to prepare access for the large forces to use later. 
				They built beach and interior land access, roads, bridges, air strips, fortifications and communication lines in theaters of war all under enemy fire.  
				On this site the ReturningTenTribes.org “Remnant of the Almighty” in our time is alternately referred to as the “Seabees of the Almighty.” 
				They are to be preparatory troops in the process of the Redemption of Israel. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>Season and time:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				At the time of the beginning awakening of the Ten Tribes in the Valley of Dry Bones, the small, select, special forces of the Remnant are called up into action.  
				The time is “the prophesied “latter days.” The season is the transition time for the Returning Ten Tribes (RTT) from being “spiritually dead” to becoming spiritually alive.”  
				It is a season of learning, and thereby coming out of the opened prison houses. That is why this site has to do with classes with lessons for learning essential basics.  
				This part of it is called “Boot Camp” for the (RTT). 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>To build up:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The Remnant are selected to awaken first in the valley of dry Bones. 
				They are called up first to volunteer because they are commissioned to build “the Road of Return.” 
				On this prophesied straight path of the “Highway for the People” the millions of the RTT of Israel are to return to 
				their lost identities to be restored to their assigned function as the forgiven, bona fide members of Israel, the “Kingdom of Priests.” 
				Concomitantly, they are to build “the road for the return of the God of Israel to His People. This is explained in a later lesson.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>To pluck up:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The Remnant is to pluck up, clean up and remove the time-honored errors and lies from the Ancient Paths of the Torah on which the RTT 
				are to return home to their God. These stumbling blocks are the accumulated trash, weeds, additions, deletions, exits, dead ends, crooked alterations 
				and blatant idolatries. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>To plant:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				This small force of the “saving” Remnant is deployed to all parts of the world to build the commanded bases around the world where the Remnant of the RTT are to network and gather together for learning. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>To break down:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Armed forces “break things.”  This is a major task of the Remnant, to break down, demolish the idolatries and the theological edifices the Ten Tribes have inherited from their fathers, teachers, pastors and cultures.  These mind- forged manacles have imprisoned the Ten Tribes in their spiritual prison houses for some three thousand years. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>To kill:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Yes, the Remnant is to lead in asking the Almighty to kill the evil inclination in our human nature by transforming  it into a positive force with which to “love the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob with all of one’s heart, all one’s soul and all one’s might.” 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>To heal:</strong>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The Ten Tribes are described as “sick” and in desperate need of the healing of their split hearts.  A major task of the benevolent forces of the “saving” Remnant is to be “instruments of healing” in the hands of the Almighty, who is called the “Healer of Israel.”
			</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The classes and lessons in this Boot Camp will enlarge upon the amazing “revealed” Scriptural details on the above “military” principles on which the “latter-day” Construction Battalion, i.e. the “Seabees of the Almighty” are slated to operate.

				Many key Scriptural references on this site are marked with the letters <span class="orange"><strong>PR</strong></span> in  <span class="orange"><strong>ORANGE</strong></span>. They stood for “<span class="orange"><strong>P</strong></span>ersonal <span class="orange"><strong>R</strong></span>evelations which for over 20 years were received during before or after prayer. They fall into only two categories: Matters re the Ten Tribes and personal correction and encouragement for the author.  Now they are still marked with an <span class="orange"><strong>ORANGE PR</strong></span>, but stand for <span class="orange"><strong>P</strong></span>ublic <span class="orange"><strong>R</strong></span>evelation. The time has come for that.
