			<br/>
			<p class="indent">
				As volunteers in the Almighty's latter-day Remnant "service" you have been mustered to this meeting because you are about to embark on "basic training" in the 
				BOOT CAMP designed to front-load you with necessary knowledge to begin the education you will need to do the vital tasks your Commander-in-Chief has prophesied 
				by His prophets for the guidance of the Returning Ten Tribes of Israel.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				Some may ask, "Why is there a "military theme" throughout this site?  
				Is such a warlike theme "appropriate" for a site which has to do with Biblical orientation whose ultimate goal is peace?" 
				This is an appropriate question to ask by many Biblically oriented persons,  especially by those who are committed to the regathering of the Tribes of Israel. 
				The main reasons for a military theme for the RegatheringTenTribes.org are contained in the inspired wisdom of King Solomon: 
			</p>
			<p class="constrict blue justify center">
				To every thing there is a <strong>season</strong>, and a <strong>time</strong> to every <strong>purpose</strong> under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to <strong>plant</strong>, and a time to <strong>pluck up</strong> that which is planted; A time to <strong>kill</strong>, and a time to <strong>heal</strong>; a time to <strong>break down</strong>, and a time to <strong>build up</strong>;  
				— Ecc. 3:1-3 KJV
			<p>
			<p>
				This key verse contains all the essential activities that a military operation does.  These are also all necessary tasks that the Almighty’s Remnant is required to do.  
				Here is a short correlation of Solomon’s observation of the scope of human activities (everything) and the assigned specially purposed “holy tasks” for the Remnant to do. 
			</p>
			<strong>Purpose:</strong>
			<p class="center" style="width:46%">
				<span class="blue">The LORD is a man of war, The LORD is His name</span>
				<span class="blue align-right">הוָה אִישׁ מִלְחָמָה יְהוָה שְׁמו</span>
				<span class="blue align-right">—  Ex. 15:3 KJV</span>                                                  
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				The God of Israel calls himself “A Man of War.” The very purpose, the singular raison d’etre of the Remnant is to be a “saving” 
				Remnant in the “service” of the same God of Israel who went to war in order to save Israel from slavish imprisonment in idolatrous Egypt.  
				In the first commandment God’s primary identity is intrinsically connected to having brought Israel out of bondage.  This “saving” event was an “act of war.”
			</p>
			<p class="constrict blue center">
				I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
				<span class="align-right">— Ex. 20:3 KJV </span> 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The “saving Remnant” of this “Man of War” is called to <strong>serve</strong> as God’s appointed special forces, “armed” 
				with the power of God’s Spirit to carry out essential parts of His plan for saving Israel in times of existential crises.  
				Yes, it is a “service” just as the armed forces of our countries are a “service” with multiple tasks. 
				Yet, as “government issues” (GIs) of the Almighty, the overall purpose of His Remnant is to defend and promote the safety of the 
				people whose God-given values and government they are sworn to uphold. In our days these ”special forces” can be best understood by 
				likening them to the official “<strong>C</strong>onstruction <strong>B</strong>attalion” of the United States Navy. 
				These men have gallantly distinguished themselves as the vital preparatory leading edge of our armed forces around the world.  
				They were popularly called “Seabees,” mostly senior men who were experienced in the trades necessary to prepare access for the large forces to use later. 
				They built beach and interior land access, roads, bridges, air strips, fortifications and communication lines in theaters of war all under enemy fire.  
				On this site the ReturningTenTribes.org “Remnant of the Almighty” in our time is alternately referred to as the “Seabees of the Almighty.” 
				They are to be preparatory troops in the process of the Redemption of Israel. 
			</p>
			<strong>Season and time:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				At the time of the beginning awakening of the Ten Tribes in the Valley of Dry Bones, the small, select, special forces of the Remnant are called up into action.  
				The time is “the prophesied “latter days.” The season is the transition time for the Returning Ten Tribes (RTT) from being “spiritually dead” to becoming spiritually alive.”  
				It is a season of learning, and thereby coming out of the opened prison houses they have been in for some 2700 years. That is why this site has to do with classes with lessons for learning essential basics.  
				This part of it is called “Boot Camp” for the (RTT). 
			</p>
			<strong>To build up:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				According to the Prophets an early contingent of the Remnant candidates are selected by the ALmighty to awaken first from among the many spiritually dead in 
				the Valley of Dry Bones. They are called up first because they are likely to volunteer to enlist in the Almighty's "special forces" to be commissoned to build 
				"The Road of Return." On this prophesied straight path of the "Highway for the People" the millions of the RTT of Israel are to return to their lost identities as 
				"Brit Am," People of the Covenant (Isa 42:6, 49:8). These "Seabees of God" are slated to be restored first to their asisgned function as the forgiven, bona fide members of 
				Israel, the "Kingdom of Priests." Concomitantly, they are to buld "the road for the return" of the God of Israel to His People. These points are explained in later lessons.
			</p>
			<strong>To pluck up:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				The Remnant is to pluck up, clean up and remove the time-honored errors and lies from the Ancient Paths of the Torah on which the RTT 
				are to return home to their God. These "stumbling blocks" are the accumulated theological, doctrinal and hereneutical trash, weeds, additions, 
				deletions, exits, dead ends, crooked alterations, pious misleading detours and blatant abominable idolatries.
			</p>
			<strong>To plant:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				This small force of the “saving” Remnant is deployed to all parts of the world to build/plant the commanded bases around the world where the 
				Remnant of the RTT are to network and "gather together" for learning. 
			</p>
			<strong>To break down:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				Armed forces "break things." This is also a major task of the Remnant, to break down, demolish the idolatries and the theological edificse the Ten Tribes have inherited 
				from their fathers, teachers, pastors, cultures and made up themselves. These mind-forged manacles have imprisoned the Ten Tribes in their spiritual prison houses for some 
				three thousand years and have deluded them with the infectious Stockholm Syndrome of "churchianity" for the last two thousand years.
			</p>
			<strong>To kill:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				yes, the Remnant is to lead in asking the Almighty to kill the evil inclination in our human nature by transforming it into a positive force with which to "love the God of Abraham, 
				Isaac and Jacob with all of one's heart, all one's soul and all one's might." The Remnant as the "few faithful" are to be pioneers in submitting to this disciplinary process 
				by the Almighty.
			</p>
			<strong>To heal:</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				The Ten Tribes are describe as "sick" and in desperate need of the healing of their "split hearts" (Hosea 10:2, 11:12, Psalm 86:11, Jer. 32:39). A major task of the 
				benevolent forces of the "saving" Remnant is to be "instruments of healing" in the hands of the Almighty who is called the "Healer of Israel" (Ex. 15:26).
			</p>
			<strong>Revelation</strong>
			<p class="indent">
				"Revelation" is one of the prime foundations of this site. That is so because it is the means of the Almighty's parental "guidance" for His children. As with human 
				families, the parents are the ones who reveal and teach to children what proper behavior is and they are the fountain of knowledge in their upbrining. Though the Creator's children 
				are in the school of experiential learning called Earth, still moral and ethical knowledge and guidance are to be gained by revelation from the Creator Parent. That "revelation" has 
				been recorded and preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures. Those Scriptures are the heritage of Jacob.
			</p>
			<p class="constrict blue center">
				Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. - Deut.33:4 (KJV)
				<span class="align-right">Some Hebrew Words</span> 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<hr style="display:block;width:20%;margin:0;"/>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<sup>1</sup>The Hebrew here is <span class="blue" style="display:inline">some hebrew word</span>/morasha, which can be translated as "heirloom" and implies "possession," "desire," i.e. like a 
				valuable desired possession of a family heirloom with profound meanings. It has three compononents, Torah, land and people, all given by God. Jewish tradition (Gemarah) says this 
				is the first concept to teach children when they begin to talk. See: Isa. 58:14, Ps. 119:111.
			</p>
			<p>
				That means that all subsequen revelations must be consisten with thtat same Torah revealed and delivered at Mt. Sinai. The words of the Prophets have to be following 
				suit and be also consisten with those principles, intent and spirit.
			</p>
			<p>
				The classes and lessons in this Boot Camp will enlarge upon the amazing “revealed” Scriptural details on the above “military” principles on which the “latter-day” Construction Battalion, i.e. the “Seabees of the Almighty” are slated to operate.
			</p>
			<p class="blue constrict center">
				To the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. : - Isa. 8:20 (KJV)
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				One of these "revelations" given to the Remnant was a dream (a <span style="display:inline;color:#e46d09;font-weight:bold">PR</span>, not to the author) which has an unmistakable military setting and describes the nature of the Remnant's current condition, status, what they need to acknolwedge and undergo in order to be able to do for what they were "called up" to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Be sure to carefully study through the dream article given in 2011. In it you will find out wher eyou are now and where you are called up to go in order to be a useful and profitable servan in the Almighty's Service battalion. It is to be seriously and prayerfully contemplated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Go and study that <a href="#">dream</a> now. After you have studied taht dream revelation and talked to God about it, come back to this Orientation article and proceed to your Boot Camp classes.

			<strong>What you will be doing next:</strong>
			<p>
				Going to these classes will not be enough for training. Though the knowledge you will gain in them will be "basic," they will be the essential foundations on which you will build "experiential" knowledge you will accrue by "doing." Besides reading and testing yourself and your "study-buddies" and discussing the principles you must, digest, inculcate and know. You will be praying and listening and even beginning to do what you have been selected to do with your "battle-buddies." Yes, battle-buddies because through the "Work" in wo which you have enlisted is one of the "building and restoration," it will call for "action" on the battle-fields of "Good vs. Evil" which are to preced the Great Shabbat. Having battle-buddies will be as necessary as being personally and constantly in touch with our Divine Headquarters as well
